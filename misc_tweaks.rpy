## For those wondering what this file is.. ##
## This serves as a way of fixing existing bugs or smaller issues seen in the last versions of the game (v1.2) ##
## It mainly covers bug-fixing, but it also makes small tweaks to some scenes such as including conditionals to dialogue where it previously wasn't before. ##
## See the list below for more info. ##

## This file is already included in Leftovers, so please do not have this file twice!! ##

## List ##
#1 Ability to rename Julia during her intro, as well as Kacey and Vicky (currently cant do this in the base game)
#2 Janet's intro should take place downstairs and not in Nate's room so everyone's not in Nate's room (lol)
#3 Conditional for if you've done the racing minigame with Kira during Janet's intro
#4 Fix Nate changing back his clothes (for instance if he's naked) when you reached the "scene limit"/revisit scene limit for the day with a character, such as Nate saying "Maybe I can do that tomorrow?". Also applies to a check with Nate not having enough Boldness, i.e. "I don't know if I'm ready for that yet"
#5 Conditional for Kira's convo where she mentions people training one "muscle" over and over.
#6 The stream with Sam/Nate will now give money the second time they stream.
#7 Fixed Nate sleeping in his underwear still if the player has fucked everyone at home.

# Will be covered by DrX in a future update for IA:
# Extended list for triggering the first masturbation.
# Much more conditionals!
